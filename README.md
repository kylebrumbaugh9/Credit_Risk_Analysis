# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to apply machine learning to evaluate credit card risk with a multitude of algorithms and machine learning models. In this analysis, I looked at RandomOverSampler, SMOTE, ClusterCentroids and SMOTEENN algorithms to look at oversampling, undersampling, and a combination. I also looked at BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifer machine learning models to predict credit risk. Then, I evaluated the results and have determined my recommendations in the summary section below

### Technology used

I used Jupyter notebook, the scikitlearn and imbalanced-learn libraries, as well as numpy, pandas, Path, and Counter. Most of the code itself is written in Python.

Results: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

Results:

There is a bulleted list that describes the balanced accuracy score and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models (15 pt)

Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.

Summary:

There is a summary of the results (2 pt)
There is a recommendation on which model to use, or there is no recommendation with a justification (3 pt)
